# decentralization

Some concepts will be introduced in this section: DeFi, DAO, DApps, and Smart Contracts etc.

## Introduction to DeFi

DeFi stands for Decentralized Finance. It is a movement that aims to create an open-source, permissionless, and transparent financial service ecosystem that is available to everyone and operates without any central authority. DeFi is built on blockchain technology and smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.

## DeFi use cases

- stablecoin: A type of cryptocurrency that is pegged to a stable asset, such as the US dollar, to reduce volatility.
- crypto borrowing and lending: Users can borrow and lend cryptocurrencies without the need for a traditional financial intermediary.
- decentralized exchanges (DEXs): DEXs allow users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with one another without the need for a centralized intermediary.
- yield farming: Yield farming is a way to earn passive income with your cryptocurrency holdings by providing liquidity to DeFi protocols.

## Smart contracts and DApps

- smart contracts (*in code we trust that*): Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They automatically enforce the terms of the agreement and execute the contract when the conditions are met.
  - limit: The DAO hack in 2016, where an attacker exploited a vulnerability in the smart contract code to steal $50 million worth of Ether. Due to the hard fork, the stolen funds were returned to the original owners.
- DApps: Decentralized applications (DApps) are applications that run on a decentralized network of computers, rather than a single server. DApps are built on blockchain technology and smart contracts, which allow them to operate without any central authority.

## How dose a DAO work?

- DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. It is an organization that is run by rules encoded as computer programs called smart contracts. DAOs are designed to be transparent, decentralized, and autonomous, with no central authority controlling the organization.
