# decentralization

Some concepts will be introduced in this section: DeFi, DAO, DApps, and Smart Contracts etc.

## Introduction to DeFi

DeFi stands for Decentralized Finance. It is a movement that aims to create an open-source, permissionless, and transparent financial service ecosystem that is available to everyone and operates without any central authority. DeFi is built on blockchain technology and smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.

## DeFi use cases

- stablecoin: A type of cryptocurrency that is pegged to a stable asset, such as the US dollar, to reduce volatility.
- crypto borrowing and lending: Users can borrow and lend cryptocurrencies without the need for a traditional financial intermediary.
- decentralized exchanges (DEXs): DEXs allow users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with one another without the need for a centralized intermediary.
- yield farming: Yield farming is a way to earn passive income with your cryptocurrency holdings by providing liquidity to DeFi protocols.
