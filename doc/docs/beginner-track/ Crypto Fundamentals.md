The blockchain's security is based on the cryptographic principles. In this section, we will learn about the basic cryptographic concepts that are used in the blockchain.

## What is Cryptocurrencies?

First, we use the gold as a currency, then we use the paper money, and now we are using the digital currency. The term gold is difficult to carry, and the paper money is easy to carry but can be easily stolen. Different Countries have the fiat currency, and the value of the fiat currency is controlled by the government.

To overcome these problems, the digital currency is introduced. The digital currency is a **decentralized currency**, and the value of the digital currency is not controlled by the government. The digital currency is also known as cryptocurrencies.
