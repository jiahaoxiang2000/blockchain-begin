This course encompasses a series of modules focusing on the basics of **blockchain** technology, **cryptocurrencies**, decentralized **finance** (DeFi), **Web3**, and trading and investing strategies.

## Blockchain

- blockchain is  a distributed ledger technology.
- specific type of database.
  - data can be add
  - data cannot be removed
  - each block data is linked to the previous block data
  - each block contains a hash for it identification, and the hash based on the previous block.
- no central authority, each node has a copy of the blockchain.

### History of Blockchain

- 1991: Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta described for time-stamping digital documents.
- 2004: Hal Finney introduced a system called reusable **proof of work** (RPOW). issue of the **double-spending problem**.
- 2008: Satoshi Nakamoto published a whitepaper called "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System".
- 2009: Bitcoin network was launched.
- 2013: Vitalik Buterin proposed **Ethereum**, a blockchain platform that supports **smart contracts**, which is a programs on the blockchain that automatically execute when certain conditions are met. DApps (decentralized applications) can be built on top of Ethereum.

### How Does Blockchain Work

- authentication message: digital signature by the asymmetric encryption algorithm. To auth who is the sender.
- transform message on the peer-to-peer network.

#### Double-spending Problem

Double-spending is a potential issue in a digital cash system where the same funds are sent to two recipients at the same time.

- The centralized approach: blind sign a message to a bank, and the bank will check the balance and sign the transaction.
- The decentralized approach: blockchain, the network will check the balance and sign the transaction.
